# Ford GoBike System Data Analysis
## by Guilherme Teixeira de Mello


## Dataset

> The data was gathered into Udacity's classroom environment, and it contains data related to the service use in the year of 2019. The data has information about the duration of each trip, about the location of the stations where the trips started and ended, and also relevant information about the profile of each user.

## Prerequisites

> In order to produce the visualizations that I've produced here, you'll need to import / install the following:
    * Pandas
    * Numpy
    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn
    * Scikitlearn


## Summary of Findings

> I found that the majority of users, use the service in order to commute, as they tend to take trips near the hours of we are usually commuting both to work of home, and also that the great majority of users are men, and that these patterns are consistent across the three regions that we examined (San Francisco, East Bay and San JosÃ©)


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The key insights that I had exploring this dataset were regarding the improvement in service, first of all, we can see that the service has the power to convert customers into subscribers, so we can suppose that we can drive our efforts in order to attract more customers since they tend to convert into subscribers. This can direct the company's effort into this area instead of developing new campaigns to convert customers into subscribers.

> Another insight that is important to mention here is that we need to develop some strategy in order to attract more women to the service, since the great majority of users are men, we need to further examine what we can do in order to provide a better experience to women at the same time as we attract them to our service.
